Ok, **Who Am I?**.

I'm a college student, skater, web developer, music listener, sometimes bath taker and owner of a very curious mind regular boy in its mid 20's trying to make it in life as most people by giving (or trying to give) the most out of me.

Things I like:

- Memes
- Skating
- Music
- Photography
- Coding (yes I actually like coding(when is not Java))
- Traveling (of course)
- Coffee
- **People that don't litter**
- More memes

And yep that's basically me.
